# CTF Writeups

Walkthroughs and notes from Capture the Flag challenges I’ve completed on TryHackMe. Each writeup documents how I got in, what I found, how I escalated, and what I learned.

These aren’t just solutions. They show the process, mistakes, dead ends, and the final working path.

## Featured Writeups

These stand out for full chains, clean execution, or strong documentation:

- [Agent Sudo](./TryHackMe/agent-sudo.md)
- [TomGhost](./TryHackMe/tomghost.md)
- [Jack of All Trades](./TryHackMe/jack-of-all-trades.md)
- [Smag Grotto](./TryHackMe/smag-grotto.md)

## All Writeups

The full list is in [`TryHackMe/README.md`](./TryHackMe/README.md)

## Tools Used

Most of these boxes involved some mix of:

- Nmap, Gobuster, FFUF, Hydra, Burp Suite
- LinPEAS, WinPEAS, Enum4Linux, Metasploit
- Python, Bash, and custom scripts
- Manual analysis and trial-and-error

## Why I Write These

To sharpen my process. To keep a record. And to show proof that I’ve done the work.
